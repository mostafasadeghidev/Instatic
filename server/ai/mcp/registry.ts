/**
 * MCP tool registry — the full set of tools an external MCP client may use,
 * filtered to the connector's granted capabilities.
 *
 * Two execution classes are exposed:
 *   - server-resolved tools (content reads + `site_list_documents` +
 *     `site_read_styles`) run in-process and work with NO editor open;
 *   - browser tools (structure edits, HTML/CSS authoring, design tokens, page
 *     lifecycle, content CRUD, code assets, live-DOM reads) are relayed to the
 *     connector owner's matching open Site or Content workspace via the live
 *     editor bridge (`./editorBridge`). If that workspace is not connected,
 *     the call returns a clear scope-specific error.
 *
 * The editor's live store is the single source of truth: ALL page editing goes
 * through it (browser tools). There is deliberately no headless DB-mutating
 * page-tree tool — that created a second surface with identical node ids that
 * desynced from the open editor and got clobbered by its autosave.
 *
 * Capability filtering reuses the SAME gate the built-in agent uses
 * (`toolAllowedForCapabilities`): a connector without `ai.tools.write` never
 * sees a mutating tool, and a tool's `requiredCapabilities` (ANY-OF) must be
 * held. An MCP caller can never invoke a tool the granting capabilities
 * couldn't authorize over HTTP.
