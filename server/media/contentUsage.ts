/**
 * Which pages use these files — worked out from the site itself, not from a
 * stored index.
 *
 * The counterpart to `media_usage_refs`, and the split between them is the
 * point: a stored reference suits a SETTING, which has one writer and an
 * explicit set/unset — an avatar, a favicon, a logo. Page content has
 * neither. It is written continuously by the collab relay, and removing an
 * image produces no event at all, so a table would fill with references to
 * nodes that no longer exist and the warning would start being wrong.
 *
 * A wrong warning is worse than none: an operator who is misled once stops
 * reading it. So this computes the answer at the moment it is asked, from
 * `getDraftSiteDocument` — which cannot drift, because there is nothing to
 * keep in sync.
 *
 * Deliberately reads DRAFTS, not the published artefacts: an image placed on
 * an unpublished page is still in use, and a warning that only knew about live
 * pages would let a delete quietly break the next publish.
 *
 * And it reads EVERY branch. Media is shared across branches while pages are
 * not, so purging a file removes it from all of them at once — an image that
 * only a branch uses breaks that branch's preview now, and the live site the
 * moment the branch merges. Main is reported plainly; a branch is named only
 * where it adds something main does not already say, so a site with five
 * branches does not list the same page five times.
 *
 * The cost lands where it belongs. The walk is O(branches × site), and it runs
 * only when someone asks to permanently delete something — never on a page
 * load, never on a trash. For the site sizes this product is built for, that
 * is milliseconds on an action that is about to be irreversible. If a site ever
 * grows past that, the fix is to cache this — with the walk still the source
 * of truth, so the cache can be checked against it.
