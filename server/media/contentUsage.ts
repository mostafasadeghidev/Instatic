/**
 * Which pages use these files — worked out from the site itself, not from a
 * stored index.
 *
 * The counterpart to `media_usage_refs`, and the split between them is the
 * point: a stored reference suits a SETTING, which has one writer and an
 * explicit set/unset — an avatar, a favicon, a logo. Page content has
 * neither. It is written continuously by the collab relay, and removing an
 * image produces no event at all, so a table would fill with references to
 * nodes that no longer exist and the warning would start being wrong.
 *
 * A wrong warning is worse than none: an operator who is misled once stops
 * reading it. So this computes the answer at the moment it is asked, from
 * `getDraftSiteDocument` — which cannot drift, because there is nothing to
 * keep in sync.
 *
 * The cost lands where it belongs. Walking every page tree is O(site), and it
 * happens only when someone asks to permanently delete something — never on a
 * page load, never on a trash. For the site sizes this product is built for,
 * that is a few milliseconds on an action that is about to be irreversible.
 * If a site ever grows past that, the fix is to cache this — with the walk
 * still the source of truth, so the cache can be checked against it.
 *
 * Deliberately reads the DRAFT document, not the published artefacts: an
 * image placed on an unpublished page is still in use, and a warning that
 * only knew about live pages would let a delete quietly break the next
 * publish.
